## Development

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Setup

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/teacherspet.git
cd teacherspet

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run in development mode
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Package for Windows
npm run package
```

### Project Structure

```
src/
├── main/          # Electron main process
│   └── main.ts    # IPC handlers, file I/O, window automation
├── preload/       # IPC bridge (context isolated)
│   └── preload.ts
└── renderer/      # React frontend
    ├── components/
    │   ├── Layout/

    │   └── common/
    └── stores/
        └── appStore.ts  # Zustand state management (~1500 lines)
```

### Architecture

- **Process Model**: Electron main process handles all system interaction; renderer is fully sandboxed
- **State Management**: Single Zustand store with all application state
- **Storage**: `data/config.json` with automatic persistence
- **Windows Automation**: PowerShell scripts for window enumeration and focus/paste
- **Link Checking**: Uses Electron's `net` module with HEAD then GET fallback (10s timeout)

## Tips & Tricks

### Lab Management
- Assign lab numbers to sections (shows as badge)
- Lab poll template uses `<LAB_NUMBER>` placeholder
- Timer launcher auto-populates lab times
- Track lab count per day automatically

### Link Organization
- Use custom titles for clarity
- Add additional URLs for related resources
- Collapse completed sections
- Mark important links with custom titles

### Window Targeting
- **Contains mode**: Flexible matching (e.g., "Zoom" matches "Zoom Meeting")
- **Regex mode**: Advanced patterns (e.g., "sec541-.*student")
- Test patterns with "Select from open windows"
- Enable "Press Enter after paste" for auto-submit

### Break Alerts
- Configure break alert theme in Theme tab
- Set alert timing (default: 5 minutes)
- Mark scheduled times as "Break?" to enable
- Theme auto-reverts after break period

---

## Troubleshooting

### Links not pasting to window
1. Check window target pattern in Settings → General
2. Verify target window is open and visible
3. Try "Contains" match mode for flexibility
4. Use "Select from open windows" to test

### Links showing as broken incorrectly
1. Some sites block HEAD requests - app automatically retries with GET
2. Check site in browser to verify accessibility
3. Some sites may require authentication
4. Timeout is 10 seconds - slow sites may fail

### Timer not launching
1. Check timer font is installed
2. Close any existing timer windows
3. Verify lab numbers are assigned correctly

### Configuration not saving
1. Check write permissions for `data/config.json`
2. Export configuration as backup
3. Restart application
